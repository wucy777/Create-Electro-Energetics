/**
 * Answers one question - is anybody aboard this train standing up - and puts them in a seat when there is
 * one to put them in.
 *
 * <h2>What "seated" means, and the mistake this class made first</h2>
 *
 * <p>A player sitting on a train does NOT ride a seat entity. They ride the carriage itself, and Create
 * records which seat index they occupy in {@code Contraption.seatMapping}. That mapping is the only
 * authority, and it is what {@code AbstractContraptionEntity.addSittingPassenger} writes and what
 * {@code getSeatOf(uuid)} reads.
 *
 * <p>This class originally tested {@code getVehicle() instanceof SeatEntity}. That is how a seat block
 * standing in the world works, and it is wrong for a train: every seated passenger rides the carriage, so
 * every one of them counted as standing. With the ceiling gated on that answer the train would have been
 * capped whenever anybody was aboard, and the seating pass would have tried to re-seat people who were
 * already sitting.
 *
 * <h2>Who counts as aboard</h2>
 *
 * <p>Two collections Create already maintains, per carriage:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code collidingEntities} - entities resting on the contraption. A player standing in the carriage,
 *       or on its roof, is in it. A player on the platform is not.</li>
 *   <li>{@code getIndirectPassengers()} - riders, including seated passengers.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Spectators are excluded: not counted, not carried, not followed.
 *
 * <h2>Free seats come from the carriage, not the world</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code Contraption.getSeats()} lists every seat position in the carriage and the seat mapping says
 * which are taken, so a free seat is an index in the former that is absent from the latter. Only THIS
 * train's carriages are read, so a nearer seat on another train, or a seat block standing in the world, can
 * never be used.
